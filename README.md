# DNN Backdoor Trigger Recovery

This repository contains a reimplementation of the underlying Sequential Monte Carlo method, dubbed Importance Splitting, used in my paper named "REStore: Exploring a Black-Box Defense against DNN Backdoors using Rare Event Simulation" [1,2].

### What this method is for

**Importance Splitting is a Sequential Monte Carlo method developped by CÃ©rou et al.** [3] to efficiently samples observations of a rare event in a given search space, by iteratively partitioning this search space into nested, progressively rarer regions. 
The rare event thus occupies the bottom-most region in this search space.

In [1], empirical evidence shows that a **black-box** Deep Neural Network can be interrogated with Importance Splitting to find high-scoring input perturbations.
The paper demonstrates such perturbations can be used to reverse-engineer hidden backdoor triggers or universal adversarial patterns.

### Implementation in this repository

This code is a reimplementation, not the original code used to produce the paper, of Importance Splitting.
It contains:

1. a quick-and-dirty training pipeline for a CIFAR10 classifier model
2. a example backdoor injection method (poison-label, all-to-one) as a python class
3. a trained model containing 2 backdoor triggers
4. a corresponding example recovery for each trigger

### How to reproduce the content of this repository

Here is how to setup the environment for pytorch GPU 11.8 [4] using conda only (have it installed first [5]).

```console
$ conda create -n pytorch python=3.10
$ conda activate pytorch
$ pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

Then you can train and run the importance splitting recovery method as such:

```console
$ python train.py
$ # TO COMPLETE
```
